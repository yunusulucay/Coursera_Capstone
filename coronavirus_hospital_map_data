Previous section we specified the problem that we will solve. The problem was to find the coronavir√ºs patients location first.
After finding the patients, showing them the nearest hospital to go. So for this we need patients' location and hospitals' locations.
We can get hospitals' locations from Foursquare location data but there is no data to find which corona patient is where.
And this is not too important because I will specify some locations for the patients in different places. 
In this way, we can find the hospitals near to the patient and show the nearest one.
